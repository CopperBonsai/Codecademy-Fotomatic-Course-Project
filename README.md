# Codecademy-Fotomatic-Course-Project
Personal Work on the Codecademy Fotomatic course project.

I have added small notations where I added or took out information.
Please note *Spoilers* the css file style_plusSolutionComparison.css is mostly for my own notes of where the solution varied from my own attempts.
I am a student web dev so there is more to what I wrote/changed than there is in the solution provided (tho they forgot to edit out a few things too hehe) so please take it as it is - the best I could do at this time.
Was both hard and wonderful to work on and make me think and learn, what a course is suppose to do.

Thank you for reviewing my code.
